                <p>Limitations only exist if you impose them upon yourself within your mind. <br> Many limit
                    themselves
                    on
                    what they can accomplish in life because they <br> are not aware. May these quotes inspire your
                    to
                    set no
                    limits on your life <br> and go after your dreams. <br>
                    “Yet I also believe that when you do unto others, blessings come to you <br> as well. So if you
                    don't
                    have a friend, be a friend. If you are having a bad <br> day, make someone else's day. If your
                    feelings
                    are hurt, heal those of another.”</p>
